    I was having trouble running the above steps. What worked for me was to brew install gdal proj and then run
    pip install geopandas
    Hope this may help someone later on.

    This worked for me, too! Thanks ðŸ˜˜

- [STPredict package](https://pypi.org/project/stpredict/)
  - STPredict is designed to apply forecasting methods on spatio-temporal data in order to predict the values of a target variable in the future time points based on the historical values of the features. The main stages of the modeling process are implemented in this package, including:
    - Data preprocessing
    - Data partitioning
    - Feature selection
    - Model selection
    - Model evaluation
    - Prediction

## Spatiotemporal deep learning

Le, V.-D., Bui, T.-C., Cha, S.K. (2019). Spatiotemporal deep learning model for citywide air pollution interpolation and prediction.([pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12919.pdf))

> Recently, some air pollution related research has leveraged Machine Learning/Neural Networks based models in predicting Air pollution [3], [7], [15], [23], [24]. Most of these papers used common datasets like monitoring air pollution, meteorological data. Some papers used specific datasets such as GPS trajectories generated by over 30,000 taxis in Beijing in [23] or road networks data in [7]. The proposed air pollution predicting models are quite diversity, from cotraining-based semi-supervised learning approach [23], linear regression-based temporal predictor [24] to Spatiotemporal Semi-supervised Learning [15] and Attention Model [3]. Some research proposed grid-based air pollution interpolation or prediction. Nevertheless, they only focused on forecasting air pollution for discrete locations, not considering the whole city to be an image as in our approach. Furthermore, they used much hand-crafted spatial and temporal features that were difficult to generalize to other similar problems.

> Furthermore, we survey general Spatiotemporal Deep Learning algorithms. In [16], the authors have proposed a ConvLSTM model and used for precipitation forecasting. In the paper, the authors demonstrated that ConvLSTM was better than Fully Connected LSTM in spatiotemporal problems like moving MNIST and weather radar echo images of Hong Kong for precipitation forecasting.

> The spatiotemporal problem is also fit for the crowd flows prediction problem. In [20], the authors presented a Deep Neural Network Spatiotemporal (DeepST) for predicting crowd flows in Beijing and New York. They proposed the DeepST model based on Convolutional Neural Network and used Residual Units (as in ResNet model) to build a very deep network to capture more citywide dependencies. The last layer was a Fusion layer to combine deep network results with external factors (such as meteorology, holidays).

## implementation with tensorflow

### STResNet

A TensorFlow implementation of Deep Spatio-Temporal Residual Networks (ST-ResNet) from the paper "Deep Spatio-Temporal Residual Networks for Citywide Crowd Flows Prediction"[^10]. ST-ResNet is an end-to-end deep learning model which uses the unique properties of temporal closeness, period and trend of spatio-temporal data, to forecast the in-flow and out-flow of crowds in a city region.

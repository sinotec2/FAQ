### Creating my own slippy map from GeoTIFF images

I'd start with GeoServer on the server side. You just need to put the files on the hard drive, create an ImageMosaic store, then publish whatever layers (perhaps just one) you need.

The ImageMosaic is the critical part - that will turn your collection of aerial photographs into a single image. Note that there are likely to be some artifacts where the images join (or don't join).

The services you export depend on how you intend to use the data. If you're familiar with Leaflet, then probably a **TMS** endpoint will be the easiest option. You configure that in the "Caching defaults" part of the (built in) GeoWebCache.
...
GeoServer isn't the only option, by any means, but its a fairly easy configuration / setup, and offers the standard endpoints you're likely to be familiar with.

  - MapServer and GeoServer are two open-source, web-based mapping and geospatial servers that allow you to visualize geographic data. They both have individual strengths in terms of what they offer.
  - MapServer is used by institutions such as NASA, while GeoServer is used by some government agencies like the FAO, World Bank and Ordnance Survey. GeoServer has a larger user base and is more popular than MapServer. It has a bigger pool of resources from which to draw inspiration for its maps, features, and data.

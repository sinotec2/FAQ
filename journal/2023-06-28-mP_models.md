## 背景

### 全球現況

- Between 0.013 and 25 million metric tons per year of micro(nano)plastics are potentially being transported within the marine atmosphere and deposited in the oceans, estimated by [(Allen et al., 2022)][doi25] [^25]

### 綜合回顧及評論

- Previous observations and modeling results suggest that marine debris occurs in greater concentrations within specific regions in the North Pacific Ocean, such as the Subtropical Convergence Zone and eastern and western “Garbage Patches”. Here [Howell et al., 2012][doi13] review the major circulation patterns and oceanographic convergence zones in the North Pacific, and discuss logical mechanisms for regional marine debris concentration, transport, and retention. [^13]
- [Kooi et al., 2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-61615-5_7) review the present knowledge with respect to fate and transport modeling of plastic debris in **freshwater catchment areas**, focusing especially on nano- and microplastics.[^5]
- [Khatmullina and Chubarenko(2019)][doi16] state: the prevalence of the Lagrangian particle tracking approach, especially for floating litter. In a broader context, the present practice of MPs transport modelling follows the “selective” strategy (e.g., only a certain sub-class of MPs, or specific processes, are considered, sometimes in only one- or two-dimensional setting). The heterogeneous nature of MPs, their enormous longevity and movability in marine environment, and the wide spectrum of the involved environmental processes suggest further integration (or coupling) of different models in future, as well as application of other types of models (ensemble modeling, chaos theory approaches, machine learning, etc.) to the problems of MPs transport and fate in the marine environment.[^16]
- [Li et al. (2020)][doi12] provide a holistic overview of the modelling of microplastic transportation. [^12]

## 按照年度排序

### 2020 and before

- A mathematical model of catchment hydrology, soil erosion and sediment budgets was upgraded to enable description of MP fate by [Nizzetto et al., (2016)][doi24]. The Thames River in the UK was used as a case study. 
- A model based on satellite-tracked buoy observations and scaled to a large data set of observations on microplastic from surface trawls was used to simulate the transport of plastics floating on the ocean surface from 2015 to 2025, with the goal to assess the optimal **marine** microplastic removal locations for two scenarios: removing the most surface microplastic and reducing the impact on ecosystems, using plankton growth as a proxy. by [Sherman and Sebille (2016)][doi21] [^21]
- [NGUYEN (2018)][doi17] studied microplastic transport through hydrodynamic modelling and investigate the behaviour of microplastic particles once they are released into the Göta **River**. In order to carry out the study, three different scenarios have been simulated with the software MIKE 3 Flow Module FM (MIKE Powered by DHI). The simulated scenarios differ in settling velocity and the number of emission sources. [^17]
- [Korfiatis, D.P. (2019)][doi11] Modeling microplastics transport and fate in the **marine** environment around a wastewater effluent discharge pipe. in Microplastics in Water and Wastewater[^11]
- The gridded emissions were adopted to the Lagrangian particle **atmospheric** transport model FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle Dispersion Model) version 10.4 with detail emission model and GAINS emission model by [Evangeliou et al., (2020)][doi10][^10]
- Based on a sediment transport model, [Osinski et al., (2020)][doi18] investigate the transport of different MP model particles, PET and PVC particles with sizes of 10 and 330 µm, under **storm** conditions. A storm event was chosen because extreme wave heights cause intense sediment erosion down to depths unaffected otherwise, and are therefore critical for determining accumulation regions. [^18]

### 2021

- the transport of MPs in a **saturated porous medium** was modeled by establishing governing equations. ([Ryu et al., 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/16/7189))[^4]
- [Mountford and Morales Maqueda, (2021)][doi14] use numerical modeling to explore the accumulation and transport of positively and neutrally buoyant microplastics in both Arctic and Southern Ocean **sea ice**. [^14]
- [Xiao et al. (2021)][url22] develop a theorybased settling velocity model for MPFs in the atmosphere, predicting a much smaller aerodynamic size than a volumetrically equivalent spherical particle. [^22]

### 2022

- a new numerical framework (CaMPSim-3D) for predicting microplastics fate and transport in different aquatic settings, which consists of a Lagrangian, three-dimensional (3D) particle-tracking model (PTM) coupled with an Eulerian-based hydrodynamic modeling system (TELEMAC) by [Pilechi et al., (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X22008013)[^1]
- “Full Multi” models,a freely available open-source modelling framework to explore environmental transport and fate of nano-and microplastics in aquatic systems [(Domercq et al., 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815221003339)[^2]
- Discussion on the **Mediterranean** fluxes by [(Ayat et al., 2022)][doi6][^6]
- A three-dimensional model of the **lake** hydro-thermodynamics in the non-hydrostatic formulation is used to produce the fields of currents and the other necessary parameters for the transport model by [Tsvetova, (2022)][doi9][^9]
- A novel modeling technique will be presented based on the open source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM. It combines a new coupling approach for the hydrodynamic processes in the surface water and hyporheic zone with transport modeling of microplastics in **fluvial systems** by [Dichgans et al., (2022)][doi15][^15]
- A three-dimensional Delft3D-PART model was applied to study micro-plastics transport in the **Bach Dang estuary** by [Le et al., (2022)][doi26]. Micro-plastics as data input for the model in this study were assessed by taking water samples by 80 μm mesh size plankton net, and sediment samples by Petersen grab.  [^26]

### 2023

- **Oceanic** drag models that have been proposed to calculate the terminal settling velocity of regularly and irregularly shaped particles[(Coyle et al., 2023)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00466)[^3]
- A hydrodynamic model was developed based on the advection-dispersion equation for quantifying microplastic mixing in **submerged canopies** by [Stride et al., (2023)][doi7][^7]
- Using lattice-Boltzmann Volume-of-Fluid simulations, [Lehmann et al., (2023)][doi8] find that oceanic **rising bubbles** indeed generate a net flow of particles toward the surface.[^8]
- Using a Lagrangian particle-tracking method coupled with a validated 3D hydrodynamic model, [Summers et al. (2023)][doi20] examined the transport behavior of microplastics, as well as export ability of the Galveston Bay **estuary**.[^20]
